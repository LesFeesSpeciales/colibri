# Colibri 

Colibri is a pose library tool for Blender. It works outside of Blender with a
webserver saving/sharing the poses that you can reuse in Blender whenever you
need. 

## Install

You need two librairies.

### ws4py

Websockets for python need to be callable from Blender. Download the source code
and install it in you python package (to be confirmed)

### tornado

this library needs to be callable from the place where the webserver will be
running. It could be your computer and shell, but it could be on a dedicated
server. It does not need to be call FROM Blender.
